# Credit Scoring Analysis - Machine Learning Project

## Project Overview
This project focuses on using machine learning techniques to build a classification model for credit scoring. The model predicts whether a loan application will be approved or rejected based on the applicant's financial and demographic data.

## Directory Structure
- `data/`: Contains the dataset and preprocessed data.
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks for exploratory data analysis (EDA).
- `src/`: Python scripts for data preprocessing and machine learning modeling.
- `README.md`: Documentation for the project.
- `requirements.txt`: List of required libraries.

## How to Run the Project
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/username/ml-classification-project.git
   cd ml-classification-project
